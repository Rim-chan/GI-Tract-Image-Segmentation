    "In this Kaggle competition, we are to create a model to automatically segment the stomach and intestines on MRI scans. The MRI scans are from actual cancer patients who had 1-5 MRI scans on separate days during their radiation treatment. The objective is to develop algorithms using a dataset of these scans and to come up with creative deep learning solutions that will help cancer patients get better care.\n",
